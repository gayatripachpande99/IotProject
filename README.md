In both urban and rural farming environments, maintaining optimal growing conditions for plants is a significant challenge due to fluctuating environmental factors. Traditional farming methods often rely on manual monitoring of temperature and light intensity, which can be inconsistent and labor-intensive. Without proper real-time data, crops may suffer from inadequate light exposure or unsuitable temperatures, leading to reduced yield and poor plant health.
As climate patterns become more unpredictable and the demand for efficient agriculture , there is a pressing need for smarter, more precise solutions to manage crop conditions. Farmers and greenhouse operators require a system that provides continuous insights into key environmental parameters to ensure healthy plant growth and productivity.
Our project, Smart Agriculture: IoT-Based Light Intensity and Temperature Monitoring System, addresses this issue by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor light and temperature levels in real-time. The system employs sensors to collect environmental data and transmits it to a centralized platform, allowing users to receive instant updates and make timely decisions. By automating the monitoring process, this solution reduces the dependency on manual checks, optimizes plant care, and supports sustainable agricultural practices.# IotProject
